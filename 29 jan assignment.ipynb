    "Q14:- How is memory managed in Python?<br>\n",
    "Ans 14:- Python uses dynamic memory management, which means the Python memory manager automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation. The memory manager uses a reference counting system to track the number of references to objects in memory, and frees the memory occupied by an object when its reference count reaches zero. Additionally, Python has a garbage collector that periodically frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer being used. This ensures that Python programs are able to efficiently use memory without the need for manual memory management."

    "Q16:- Is indentation required in python?<br>\n",
    "Ans 16:- Yes, indentation is required in Python. Indentation is used to indicate the block of code associated with control structures such as loops and conditional statements. The indentation level determines the scope of the code block, and a consistent indentation style makes the code easier to read and understand. In Python, the indentation level is defined by one or more spaces at the beginning of a line. The recommended indentation level is 4 spaces, but some developers prefer 2 spaces or use tabs instead of spaces. It's important to be consistent within a single project, and most code editors can automatically handle indentation for you."
