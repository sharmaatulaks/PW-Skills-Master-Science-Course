    "Ans 1:- A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects that share common attributes and behaviors. It's a way to encapsulate related data and functions into a single unit.\n",

    "Example:-\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",

    "        self.name = name\n",

    "    def bark(self):\n",

    "\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Rex\", \"German Shepherd\")\n",
    "dog1.bark()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a class called Dog. The class has two attributes, name and breed, which are initialized when we create an instance of the class. The __init__ method is a special method that is called when a new instance of the class is created. The bark method is a function that takes no arguments and simply prints a message using the name attribute of the Dog instance. Finally, we create a Dog instance called dog1 with the name \"Rex\" and the breed \"German Shepherd\", and then call the bark method on that instance.\n",
